#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) runtime would be O(n) because `n` is constant

b) runtime would be O(n^2) because it is nested for the loop

c) runtime would be o(n) becuase its recursive with n

## Exercise II

def egg_drop(n_story): create a variable where you get the n_story and divide by
get the variable number and make a while statement. while True divide n_story by
2 until it returns did_break false

It will be O(n) since the n is a constant with one while statement
